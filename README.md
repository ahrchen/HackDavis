Hack Davis 2018
## Inspiration
Our team converged on the idea of building a space for “community”, “reflection” and “positivity”. We reflected on what made people unhappy -- the acknowledgement that there is a lack of in their lives. Therefore, we wanted to build a tool that allows them to actively store and see the “enough of” in their lives.
## What it does
Joy is a virtual positivity jar that stores moments that brings joy to the user. Moments may be an audio recording of the birds chirping, a screenshot of the sweetest message or a drawing you received from a child. You can store three types of mediums: text, audio and images. Get allows you to randomly retrieve a joyful moment.
## How we built it
We used the google cloud app engine to store all of the moments. HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/BootStrap for the front end, Google Cloud Services for the backend.
## Challenges I ran into
There was choppy wifi, hindering some of the learning processes. In terms of front end, there we went for a simple handwritten design. It was something brand new, and we had to figure out the implementation and make it happen. In addition, we spent a lot of time debugging the back end code, we are not at all familiar with back-end python and Google Cloud Services. 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
CUTE GRAPHICS THAT WE HANDMADE.  Saying YES to all design decision and implementing all of them. Learning to work with Google Cloud Services via python
## What I learned
You don’t have to aim big. A minimum viable product  over  an unattainable big step.
## What's next for Alpha Joy
Bringing it to the world, and allowing people to send positivity to each other.
